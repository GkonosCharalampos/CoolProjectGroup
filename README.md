> * Project Title: Traffic simulation in the city of Zurich

## General Introduction

Traffic is a serious problem with which every city has to deal. In the city of Zurich, traffic is also a problem and the adopted actions aim at a better organisation, which can lead to a better combination of travel safety and efficiency.

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

The goal is to develop an efficient traffic model based on our data. To implement the model in order to visualise the existing traffic situation in the city of Zurich. Then, we want to analyse the impact that a highway tunnel connecting the two sides of the lake would have in the whole area.

## Expected Results

The expected result would be an amelioration of the traffic situation in the city by declining the traffic jams in the main roads.

## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

We will make use of OpenStreetMap which provides us with the complete road network of Zurich.
It includes the type of the road (motorway, trunk, primary, etc.) and coordinates of points a long the streets.
This enables us to realistically model traffic including direction and speed of every car.
