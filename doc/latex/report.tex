\section{Description of the Model}

\section{Implementation}
We started out by extracting the OpenStreetMap file that contains Zurich.
In order to do so we downloaded a recent Switzerland extract from Geofabrik \cite{geofab} and then extracted the boundaries of Zurich with the tool \emph{Osmconvert} \cite{osmconv}.
Afterwards we used another tool called \emph{Osmosis} to limit our data to the roads in Zurich.
Furthermore we modified the data using JOSM which enabled us to simplify the road network, making our algorithms more efficient.
Once we removed small isolated connected components resulting from clipping the data to Zurich we wrote an A-Star algorithm implementation in C++.
We considered doing this directly in Matlab, however the performance loss was too large, so that we wrote the mex file.

[Model MATLAB Part]



Finally we made use of the Javascript Library Leaflet to visualize our results on the actual map of Zurich.
We enabled communication between MATLAB and Javascript using the included Java classes for Sockets.
The Javascript code issues HTTP GET requests telling the MATLAB implementation which methods to perform.
Afterwards the location of every car in Zurich was passed as an JSON object through the socket.
